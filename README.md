# Random Horoscope Generator
This simple project was created through Codecademy to demonstrate understanding of JavaScript syntax. Using this code, a user can generate a random horoscope message by entering their birthday into the program.

## How it Works
After a user enter's their birthday, the program will return the user's star sign to be used in their horoscope. The horoscope message is built from 3 arrays, one containing different greetings for the star sign, another containing various good, bad, or neutral fortunes, and the last one containing advice. A randomizing function is then used to select and return a random phrase from each array. These phrases are then printed out to the console for the user to read.

## How to Use
Using the Random Horoscope Generator is very simple:
1. At the bottom of the code, enter your birthday in `userInfo.myBirthday()`. This should be in (month, day) format and should only use numbers.
2. Run the program.
3. Get your unique horoscope!
